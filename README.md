# BoardGameGeekClientAPI

BoardGameGeekClientAPI is a client api built around the BoardGameGeek XML APIs. It should provide a more fluent interface to use when integrating with BGG through .Net apps

The project is a direct extension of these two applications,

https://github.com/ervwalter/bgg-json
https://github.com/WebKoala/W8BggApp

I'm hoping to just make an easier client to interact with and pull down into existing projects for any .Net developers out there. Thanks to WebKoala and ervwalter for your work on those projects.
